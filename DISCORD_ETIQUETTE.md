- Appropriate Language: Always choose your words carefully, avoiding offensive, derogatory, or discriminatory language. This includes refraining from excessive slang or curse words that may be confusing or offensive.
- Courtesy and Respect: Treat everyone with courtesy and respect, regardless of their position, background, or personal beliefs. This includes using appropriate titles and honorifics, actively listening to others, and valuing their opinions.
- Considerate Communication: Be mindful of how your words and actions may affect others. Avoid making assumptions, interrupting, or dismissing others' ideas. Strive to create a positive and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable and respected.
- Use the proper channels: Before contributing or commenting, follow the threads and identify the appropriate communication channel to avoid misalignment. If unsure, use the `#general` channel and ask for clarification.
- Be patient and timely: If you are waiting for a pull request or an answer to a question, be patient. If someone is waiting for you to do something for them, you should extend the same courtesy at the same time and respond as promptly as you can.
